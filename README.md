## Tutorial Overview
The Rogues Gallery is a new experimental testbed hosted at Georgia Tech that is focused on tackling "rogue" architectures for the post-Moore era of computing including those in areas like high-performance, near-memory, neuromorphic, and quantum computing. More recently, the Rogues Gallery has been awarded an NSF grant to serve as a novel architecture testbed as part of the CISE Community Research Infrastructure (CCRI) program. This tutorial will provide an introduction to this new community resource and will focus on hands on development with the signature architecture, Lucata's newly designed Pathfinder-S.

This virtually hosted tutorial will present a brief overview of the Rogues Gallery testbed and how NSF researchers can access and utilize unique hardware in the neuromorphic, smart networking, HPC, and near memory spaces to carry out related research goals for CISE-oriented research. Attendees will have an opportunity to learn about and program for the Lucata Pathfinder-S system, a near-memory computing architecture for sparse applications that has applications for database operations, graph analytics, and machine-learning related techniques. We will provide and work through a set of demonstration codes and will provide details on potential workflows that users can explore after the tutorial. Attendees will have an opportunity to continue their investigation into using the Pathfinder-S by requesting a free account to access the Rogues Gallery at the end of the tutorial.

## Login information
Please join us using PEARC's Pathable system which will allow you to join a related Zoom session. You can post questions using the chat there or on our [CRNCH RG Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gt-crnch-rg/shared_invite/zt-thaxo3ds-zyb26ZW~IjACwgE_dN7MBA).

Attendees will use notebook.crnch.gatech.edu as the main point for this tutorial and will work through several examples using Jupyter notebooks there.
