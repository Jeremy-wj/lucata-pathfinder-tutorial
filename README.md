# Lucata Pathfinder Tutorial

This repository is an extension of the 2021 PEARC tutorial and contains updated versions of the code and examples presented there. We suggest you follow along with the code notebooks.

This tutorial material was developed by Janice McMahon, formerly of Lucata, with help from Jeffrey Young for the notebooks. 

## Software Information
This tutorial is geared towards using the 22.02 version of the Lucata programming framework.
