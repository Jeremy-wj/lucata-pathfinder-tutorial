## Pathfinder Hands-on Tutorial


### Optional step 

This step is only needed if you encounter issues with your repo! In a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/lucata-pathfinder-tutorial.git
OR
/netscratch/tutorials/hpec-tutorial-2022/update_pf_tut_repo.sh
`



### Jupyter Notebook Login
If you would like to test the Jupyter Notebook interface for the Pathfinder, please use the following information.

Log into rg-ood.crnch.gatech.edu with your GT username and password. Select the “Jupyter Notebook” under Near-Memory Apps.




Check the fields (we recommend using 2 vCPUs) and hit “Launch” to start a Jupyter notebook job. You don’t need to fill in the Account field!

Wait about half a minute for the job to be launched on the server. When it switches to “Running”, you should be able to click “Connect to Jupyter” to open your Jupyter notebook on the server.

In the new window, navigate to the tutorial directory and open Notebook 1 to get started.
